        <p>
            Today I’m going to teach you everything you need to know about making the perfect buttery flaky pie crust. This is the one and only pie crust recipe I use. 
            It’s been passed down through generations. Stands the test of time. Old-fashioned, yet never out of style. Wins my heart every single time.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cold water</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the butter and shortening.</li>
            <li>Using a pastry cutter (the one I own) or two forks, cut the butter and shortening into the mixture until it resembles coarse meal (pea-sized bits with a few larger bits of fat is OK). 
                A pastry cutter makes this step very easy and quick.
            </li>
            <li>Measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water in a cup. Add ice. Stir it around. From that, measure 1/2 cup (120ml) water since the ice has melted a bit. Drizzle the cold water in, 1 Tablespoon (15ml) at a time, and stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon after every Tablespoon (15ml) added. Stop adding water when the dough begins to form large clumps. 
                I always use about 1/2 cup (120ml) of water and a little more in dry winter months (up to 3/4 cup). Do not add any more water than you need.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the pie dough to a floured work surface. The dough should come together easily and should not feel overly sticky. Using floured hands, fold the dough into itself until the flour is fully incorporated into the fats. 
                Form it into a ball. Cut dough in half. Flatten each half into 1-inch thick discs using your hands.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat the layers</li>
        </ol>
